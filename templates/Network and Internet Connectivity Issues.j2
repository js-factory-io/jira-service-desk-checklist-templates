Initial Triage:
- Identify if issue affects single user or multiple users
- Determine if issue is wired or wireless
- Check if user can access local resources vs internet
- Note user's location (office, remote, traveling)

Basic Connectivity Checks:
- Verify network cable is securely connected (if wired)
- Check Wi-Fi is enabled and connected to correct network
- Verify airplane mode is disabled
- Restart network adapter

{% if connection_type == 'wifi' %}
Wi-Fi Troubleshooting:
- Forget and reconnect to wireless network
- Check Wi-Fi signal strength
- Verify correct SSID and credentials
- Test connection to different access point
- Check for wireless driver updates
{% endif %}

{% if connection_type == 'vpn' %}
VPN Troubleshooting:
- Verify VPN client is installed and up to date
- Check VPN credentials are correct
- Test internet connectivity without VPN first
- Try alternate VPN server/gateway
- Check if split tunneling is configured correctly
- Verify MFA is completing successfully
{% endif %}

Network Diagnostics:
- Run Windows Network Diagnostics
- Check IP configuration (ipconfig /all)
- Test DNS resolution (nslookup)
- Ping gateway and external addresses
- Run traceroute to identify failure point

DNS Issues:
- Flush DNS cache (ipconfig /flushdns)
- Verify DNS server settings
- Test with alternate DNS (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- Check for DNS filtering issues

Advanced Troubleshooting:
- Release and renew DHCP lease
- Reset TCP/IP stack if needed
- Check for proxy configuration issues
- Review firewall settings

Resolution:
- Document root cause and resolution
- Escalate to network team if infrastructure issue
- Provide user with preventive guidance
- Update knowledge base if new issue pattern
